### 🗄️ The Data

I found my data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). 

If you want to read more about what each column means, check out this [file](column_names.md).

### 🚿 [Importing and Cleaning](1.%20Initial%20Import%20+%20Clean.ipynb)

The data came to me in fairly good shape. However, there were a few thousand 'unknown' values across six different features that I had to fill in.

All of the missing features were associated with categorical variables, so I just filled them in to match the already existing ratio.

### 📊 EDA

Next up, [EDA](2.%20EDA.ipynb).

Almost all of my variables were categorical features. I primarily just explored their frequencies across the data and also within each value of my target variable. 


### 🎆 Last but not least... Modeling!

I tried out a lot of different model variations - including a lot that aren't necessarily seen here. I tried to keep this area concise, keeping only my more meaningful findings and at least one of each of the types of models I tried.

Anyway, my models are [here](3.%Model%Iterations.ipynb). 

Or if sifting through code isn't your thing, feel free to check out my [final presentation](Mod%3%Presentation.pdf) - less reading and code, more photos and bullet points.
